## Introduction

Welcome to my Tetris game project. This classic and fun game of Tetris is developed using Java with the help of YouTube tutorials, and I made a few modifications and added a few features 
to make it more fun and interactive. 

## Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine using `git clone `.
2. Navigate to the directory where you cloned the repository.
3. Run `javac Tetris.java` to compile the game.
4. Run `java Tetris` to start the game.

## Gameplay

The rules of the game are the same as classic Tetris. Use the arrow keys to move the blocks. The goal is to create complete lines with the falling blocks to score points. The game ends when the pile of blocks reach the top of the screen.
